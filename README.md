# E-calculation
Project for Parallel Processing Systems course @ FMI Sofia

The program calculates the E number using a convergent row and threads. Each thread calcuates some part of the row. <br>
Command line parameters: <br>
-p N: number of elements of the row or number of iterations <br>
-t K : K threads <br>
-q : quiet mode (If we dont care about information of each thread). Only the time will be printed <br>
-o filename.txt : writes the result in filename.txt file (result.txt is the default value)
